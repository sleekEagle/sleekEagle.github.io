title: Hiding emotions in plain sight
---
With the prevalence of intelligent personal digital assistance devices like amazon Alexa, Siri andGoogle home, Privacy has become a greater concern. This is because these devices listen to the user(and other people around them) and process these vocal data and make inferences. For example these devices may learn your identity and emotional state. Some researchers are calling for a ban for emotion recognition technologies because they can be biased (e.g racially). Also it may listen to confidential and private conversations you are having. The threat becomes greater since these devices usually send the data (voice recordings) to cloud for further analysis. Some malicious agent may get hold of these data. Therefore it is important to investigate methods to mask certain attributes out from voice. For example, if we can hide the emotional content from voice, and if we can still use other voice functions (such as speech recognition), it would be beneficial
